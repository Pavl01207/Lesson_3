				<p>
					Forza Horizon was developed for the Xbox 360 and is the <mark>first open-world game</mark> in the series.
					It is based
					around a fictitious festival called the Horizon Festival, set in the U.S. state of Colorado. The game
					incorporates many different gameplay aspects from previous Forza Motorsport titles, like the large
					variety of cars, realistic physics and high definition graphics. The aim is to progress through the game
					by means of obtaining wristbands by driving fast, destroying property, winning races and other driving
					antics. Horizon features the physics of Forza Motorsport 4, which have been optimised to work on the more
					than 65 variants of terrain said to be present in the game. Players can drive off-road in select areas,
					while others are limited by guardrails or other means. Horizon allows the player to modify the car that
					is selected from the garage by changing numerous features both internally and externally on a car. One
					can also obtain cars by winning races with random drivers on the street, by winning larger competitive
					races, and by finding barns housing hidden treasure cars that cannot otherwise be bought through the
					game's "Auto-show" or through racing. The <a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Viper"
						target="_blank" title="About Car">2013 Dodge SRT Viper GTS</a> is the cover car.The game is
					backwards-compatible with the Xbox One and the Xbox Series X/S.

				<p>
					Forza Horizon 2 was developed for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One. The game is set in <mark>Southern France and
						Northern Italy</mark>, and the playing field is three times the map of its predecessor. The Xbox 360
					version was
					developed by Sumo Digital,and is the final Forza game for Xbox 360. The Xbox One version introduced
					dynamic weather and lighting systems to the series. Both versions feature day-and-night cycles and
					cross-country races of up to 12 players and two "Bucket Lists", one for France and the other for Italy.
					Bucket Lists are lists of location-specific challenges involving certain vehicles for the player to
					complete, such as driving a Ford Raptor through a forest with only headlights to light the player's way.
					Additionally, its single-player and multiplayer modes have merged to allow for seamless connectivity,
					where other players can join in or drop out of the host's session without interrupting the latter's
					progress. In this edition of Forza Horizon, "Car Meets" serves as an online hub for players to compare
					their cars and share their own designs or tunes for others to use, as well as socialize and challenge
					each other in showdown races. The <a href="https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Hurac%C3%A1n"

					Forza Horizon 3 was released for Xbox One and Windows 10 on September 27, 2016.Its support for Xbox
					Play Anywhere makes it the first Forza title to allow cross-play on the two Microsoft platforms. The game
					is set in <mark>Australia</mark>, and has the player represented in the game as the host of the Horizon
					Festival
					itself. Its topography, car roster, and cast of player avatars have all diversified. For the first time,
					the terrain includes sand and deep bodies of water that can be driven on or into, and the car roster,
					which is expanded to 350 cars, encompasses off-road racing buggies and trophy trucks. The single-player
					campaign mode adds co-op, in which up to three players join the host to complete the latter's objectives.
					Progression is kept regardless of which mode campaign is played in. A new mode called Horizon Blueprint
					allows players to edit events by changing their routes, number thereof, and time of day and determining
					which cars are eligible for the events.An expansion titled Blizzard Mountain was released on
					December 13, 2016, featuring a snow area along with the name giving blizzard storms, eight new cars, and
					the 2016 Ford Focus RSRX as its cover vehicle.A second expansion themed around Hot Wheels was
					released on May 9, 2017. This expansion features a new area called "Thrilltopia" and adds orange and blue
					Hot Wheels track with loops, jumps, corkscrews, boost pads, half-pipes and more. The expansion also
					includes ten new cars. The Hot Wheels Twin Mill is the cover vehicle.The <a

					is set in parts of <mark>England and Scotland</mark>, and features over 450 cars from more than one
					hundred
					manufacturers. It introduces a dynamic four-season scheme that rotates on a weekly basis and changes
					aspects of the environment, such as rivers drying in the summer. Places such as the Edinburgh Castle can
					now be purchased as property, unlocking benefits. For the first time, players are given the option to
					traverse the same world as others in single-player on a 72-player server. The <a

					9, 2021, and is set in Mexico. The seasons return, but to account for <mark>Mexico's diverse
						landscape</mark>,
					different parts of the map have their own weather that rotates seasonally. A new mode called Events Lab
					allows players to create races with their own rules and objectives. Also new is Forza Link, an AI
					assistant that tracks one's progress and preferred means of playing the game and the players they meet
					online. It then uses that information to match players with statistically similar interests. The
